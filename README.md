# MongoDB Aggregation Error with Arrays Containing Null or Undefined Values

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using MongoDB aggregation pipelines with arrays containing null or undefined values.

## Bug Description

The provided JavaScript code shows a simple aggregation pipeline that attempts to group documents based on the value of a field. However, if that field is an array containing null or undefined values, the pipeline will fail and throw an error.

## Bug Reproduction

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Ensure you have a MongoDB instance running and a collection with appropriate data.
3.  Run the `bug.js` script using a Node.js environment.
4.  Observe the error that occurs.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution to this problem by pre-processing the data to handle null or undefined values within the arrays. This ensures that the `$group` stage can correctly process the data without errors.
